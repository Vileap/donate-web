# **URGENT HUMANITARIAN AID FOR CAMBODIA**

This week, fighting reignited along the Cambodia–Thailand border. Thai air strikes and artillery have forced hundreds of thousands of Khmer civilians to flee for safety. Children who should have been in school were instead running for their lives, and countless families now face extreme hardship displaced from their homes, sleeping in the cold rain, without access to food, clean water, or medical care.

We are organizing an international community fundraiser to support families in Cambodia. We are accepting monetary donations, and every contribution big or small makes a real difference. All funds will be sent directly to our volunteer team on the ground in Cambodia, who are purchasing and delivering essential aid to those who need it most.
